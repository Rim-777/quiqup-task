Test Task of www.quiqup.com
TFL TIMS feed
TFL (Transport for London) have a live traffic disruptions 
feed called TIMS which can be found at Live Traffic Disruptions - TIMS, 
this and other feeds can be retrieved from https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs.
 You can use the feed immediately as it is public.
What I would like to see is a basic app that will consume the XML feed and 
show a map on a webpage with pins to highlight the locations of the disruptions.

The task is finished.
